            <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be
            updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither
            be updated nor re-declared.</p>

            <h3 class="bg-yellow-500 text-center p-3 mb-3">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?</h3>
            <p>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a
            blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type
            as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

            <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to
            and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or
            representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
